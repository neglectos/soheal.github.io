<h3>Invited keynote: Can software be healthy?</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Health, as a metaphor, is often applied to software. At first sight, it
is a tempting one. Everyone would like its software projects and products to be healthy.
If some project is not healthy, something
is wrong with it, and maybe whatever is wrong can be detected and
fixed. This leads to the idea that software health, or indicators of
being healthy, could be monitored, and policies to increase the health
of a project be put in place and tracked.

However, to which extent can the health metaphor be applied to
software? What does it mean for a software product, or for the project
producing it, to be "healthy"? The health metaphor seems to
imply that there is some "ideal" state in which every software should be.
If they are not in it, well, they are ill, and should take measures to
be healed. But how can we define this ideal state? And if we could,
does it correspond to some real situation?

The talk will explore this path, by comparing software (product and project) health with the concept of software quality. By focusing on free, open source software, where many quality models for projects
have been proposed, we will explore if we can learn some lessons that
could be useful when discussing software health. Based on them, we will
try to answer the question "what does it mean to be healthy?" for
software products and projects.
