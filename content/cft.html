<h2>Call for Talks</h2>

<p>
  <b>SoHeal</b> aims to enable and promote collaboration between academia and industry, unifying the <b>views on software health of researchers and practitioners</b>. The workshop's goals are to: (i) raise awareness of practitioners' problems with software health; (ii) familiarize practitioners with the progress made by academia; and (iii) connect the two communities to further advance the body of knowledge and state of the practice on software health.
</p>

<p>We invite  talk proposal contributions of up to 2 pages (including figures, tables and references), all submissions will peer-reviewed and must be submitted through <a href="https://soheal2020.hotcrp.com/">HotCrp</a>.<br/>
  Formatting instructions are available at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided <code>acmart.cls</code> and <code>ACM-Reference-Format.bs</code> without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., <code>\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}</code>), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., <code>\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}</code>). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. All accepted contributions will be presented during the workshop, but talk proposal contributions <b>will not</b> be included in the proceedings. <b>Talk proposals</b> of 1 to 2 pages reporting on practitioner's or industrial experience will be considered for presentation during the workshop, on the basis of an abstract of the talk and the author's biography.
</p>
